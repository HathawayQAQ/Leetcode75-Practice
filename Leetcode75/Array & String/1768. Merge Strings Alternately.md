https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

## Problem Description ##
> You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.
>
> Return the merged string.

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
> 
> Output: "apbqcr"
> 
> word1:  a   b   c
> word2:    p   q   r
> merged: a p b q c r
> 
> Example 2:
> 
> Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
> 
> Output: "apbqrs"
> 
> Example 3:
> 
> Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
> 
> Output: "apbqcd" test
> 

## First Solution - Python3 ##
```
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        
        merged = ""
        # If the word1 is longer
        if len(word1) >= len(word2):
            # # Append all the same index into the list
            for i in range(len(word2)):
                merged += word1[i]
                merged += word2[i]
            merged += word1[len(word2):]

        # If the word2 is longer
        elif len(word2) > len(word1):
            # Append all the same index into the list
            for i in range(len(word1)):
                merged += (word1[i])
                merged += (word2[i])
            merged += word2[len(word1):]
    
        return merged
```
 
## Improved Solution ##
```
class Solution:
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
        result = []
        minLength = min(len(word1), len(word2))

        for i in range(minLength):
            result.append(word1[i])
            result.append(word2[i])

        result.extend([word1[minLength:], word2[minLength:]])

        return ''.join(result)
```
