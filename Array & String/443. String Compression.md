## Problem ##
https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

## Problem Description ##
> Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:
>
> Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of consecutive repeating characters in `chars`:
> - If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
> - Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.
>
> The compressed string `s` should not be returned separately, but instead be stored in the input character array `chars`.
> Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.
>
> Return the new length of the array after compression.
>
> You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

## First Solution - Python3 ##
```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        n = len(chars)
        write = 0
        i = 0

        while i < n:
            ch = chars[i]
            j = i
            while j < n and chars[j] == ch:
                j += 1

            chars[write] = ch
            write += 1

            count = j - i
            if count > 1:
                for digit in str(count):
                    chars[write] = digit
                    write += 1

            i = j

        return write
```

### Improved Solution

```python
  class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
          n = len(chars)
          write = 0
          i = 0

          while i < n:
              start = i
              ch = chars[i]

              while i < n and chars[i] == ch:
                  i += 1

              chars[write] = ch
              write += 1

              count = i - start
              if count > 1:
                  count_str = str(count)
                  chars[write:write + len(count_str)] = count_str
                  write += len(count_str)

          return write
```
