## Problem Description

> You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.
>
> Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *new flowers can be planted in the* `flowerbed` *without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule and* `false` *otherwise*.

>**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

> **Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

## First Solution - Python 3

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        available = 0

        # Handle special case where the flowerbed length is 1
        if len(flowerbed) == 1:
            return (flowerbed[0] == 0 and n <= 1) or (flowerbed[0] == 1 and n == 0)

        # Check the first position
        if flowerbed[0] == 0 and flowerbed[1] == 0:
            flowerbed[0] = 1
            available += 1

        # Check the middle positions
        for i in range(1, len(flowerbed) - 1):
            if flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 and flowerbed[i] == 0 and flowerbed[i + 1] == 0:
                flowerbed[i] = 1
                available += 1

        # Check the last position
        if flowerbed[-1] == 0 and flowerbed[-2] == 0:
            available += 1

        return available >= n

```

## Improved Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:
        flowerbed=[0]+flowerbed+[0]
        for i in range(1,len(flowerbed)-1):
            if flowerbed[i]==0 and flowerbed[i+1]==0 and flowerbed[i-1]==0:flowerbed[i]=1;n-=1
        if n<=0:return True
        return False
```
