https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

## Problem Description ##
> Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.
>
> A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.
>
> Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
>
> Note that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.  
> The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

## First Solution - Python3 ##
```python
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        words = s.split() # remove spaces
        words.reverse()
        return " ".join(words)
