## Problem ##

https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-number-of-occurrences/

## Problem Description ##

> Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` *if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is **unique** or* `false` *otherwise*.

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
> Output: true
> Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two values have the same number of occurrences.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: arr = [1,2]
> Output: false
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
> Output: true
> ```

## First Solution - Python3 ##

``` python
class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        return len(set(Counter(arr).values())) == len(Counter(arr).values())
```

This line of Python code is checking a specific condition related to the frequency of elements in an array (or list) named `arr`. To understand what this line does, let's break down the components:

1. **`Counter(arr)`**: This is a call to the `Counter` class from Python's `collections` module. It takes the list `arr` and returns a dictionary-like object where keys are the elements of `arr`, and values are the counts (frequencies) of these elements. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, `Counter(arr)` would return `Counter({2: 2, 1: 1, 3: 1})`.
2. **`Counter(arr).values()`**: This retrieves just the counts (frequencies) of each unique element from the `Counter` object. Using the previous example, `Counter(arr).values()` would return `[2, 1, 1]`.
3. **`set(Counter(arr).values())`**: This converts the collection of counts into a set, which removes any duplicate counts. For example, if `Counter(arr).values()` returned `[2, 1, 1]`, `set(Counter(arr).values())` would return `{1, 2}`.
4. **`len(set(Counter(arr).values()))`**: This calculates the number of unique frequencies of elements in `arr`. In our example, it would be `2` (since there are two unique counts: 1 and 2).
5. **`len(Counter(arr).values())`**: This calculates the total number of different elements in `arr`, based on their frequencies. In our example, it would be `3` (since there are three counts: 2 for the number 2, and 1 each for the numbers 1 and 3).
6. **`len(set(Counter(arr).values())) == len(Counter(arr).values())`**: This line compares the number of unique frequencies of elements in `arr` with the total number of different elements in `arr`. The condition checks if every element in `arr` has a distinct frequency. In other words, it's checking if no two different elements in the array have the same count. The `return` statement then returns `True` if this condition is met, and `False` otherwise.

For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, the condition would return `True` because the counts (2 for `2`, 1 for `1`, and 1 for `3`) are not all distinct (there are two `1`s). However, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]`, the condition would return `False` because the counts (2 for `2` and 3 for `3`) are unique.
