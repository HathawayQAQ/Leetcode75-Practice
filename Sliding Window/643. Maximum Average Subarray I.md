# Sliding Window: 643. Maximum Average Subarray I

## Problem ##

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/

## Problem Description ##

> You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.
>
> Find a contiguous subarray whose **length is equal to** `k` that has the maximum average value and return *this value*. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10-5` will be accepted.

> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
> Output: 12.75000
> Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: nums = [5], k = 1
> Output: 5.00000
> ```

## First Solution - Python3 (Answer correct but Time Limit Exceed) ##

``` python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Not to set: max_aver = 0 because there're negative nums
        max_aver = sum(nums[:k]) / k

        if len(nums) == k:
            max_aver = sum(nums) / k

        for i in range(len(nums) - k + 1):
            current_sum = 0
            current_sum = sum(nums[i:i + k])
            current_aver = current_sum / k

            if current_aver > max_aver:
                max_aver = current_aver
        return max_aver
```

## Improved Solution ##

``` python
class Solution:
    def findMaxAverage(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> float:
        # Calculate the sum of the first k elements
        current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
        max_sum = current_sum

        # Slide the window, each time updating the sum
        for i in range(k, len(nums)):
            current_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)

        # Return the average of the subarray with the maximum sum
        return max_sum / k
```

### Key Concepts of Sliding Window Technique

1. **Window**: A 'window' is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by two pointers (often referred to as the left and right pointers). The window can either expand or shrink depending on the problem.
2. **Fixed-Size Window**: In some problems, the window size is fixed. You slide this fixed-size window across the array to examine each subarray of this size.
3. **Variable-Size Window**: In other problems, the window size can change. The window grows or shrinks to satisfy certain conditions, like a maximum sum or a substring containing all characters of a set.

### Common Uses

- **Maximum/Minimum Sum of Subarrays of Size K**: As in your problem, where you need to find the maximum average of subarrays of size k.
- **Longest/Shortest Substring with K Distinct Characters**: Finding substrings that satisfy certain constraints based on character types or frequencies.
- **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**: Expanding the window until a character repeats and then shrinking it from the left.
- **Subarray Sum Equals K**: Finding continuous subarrays whose sum equals a target value.

### Implementation

The implementation often involves a while or for loop, iterating through the array/string. Depending on the problem, you might need one or two nested loops to manage the window's size and position.

## Example

```python
# Compute the sum of the first window of size k
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum

    # Slide the window from start to end in the array
    for i in range(n - k):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i] + arr[i + k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)

    return max_sum
```
