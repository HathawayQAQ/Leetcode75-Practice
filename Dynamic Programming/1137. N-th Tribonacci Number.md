## My Solution - Java ##
``` java
class Solution {
    public int tribonacci(int n) {
        // Base Case
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;

        // Initialize the first three values of the Tribonacci sequence
        int t0 = 0, t1 = 1, t2 = 1;
        // Temporary variable for storing the current value during iteration
        int current = 0;

        // Calculate subsequent values up to Tn
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            current = t0 + t1 + t2;
            // Update the previous three values for the next iteration
            t0 = t1;
            t1 = t2;
            t2 = current;
        }
        // For n = 0, 1, or 2, this will return t2 which correctly represents T0, T1, and T2
        return t2;
    }
}
```

## Improved Solution - Button Up ##

``` java
class Solution {
    public static int tribonacci(int n) {
        // Handle base cases explicitly
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
        
        // Initialize an array to store Tribonacci numbers up to n
        int[] dp = new int[n+1];
        
        // Base cases
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 1;
        
        // Fill the dp array in a bottom-up manner
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3];
        }
        
        // The nth Tribonacci number is stored in dp[n]
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

The term "bottom-up" in the context of Dynamic Programming refers to the strategy of solving smaller subproblems first and using their solutions to build up the solutions to larger problems. This is opposed to a "top-down" approach, where the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems recursively, possibly with memoization to avoid recalculating the same subproblem.

In the provided Java code for the Tribonacci sequence using Dynamic Programming, the bottom-up approach is illustrated by starting the calculation with the smallest subproblems (the base cases, `T0`, `T1`, and `T2`), which are directly known without any calculation. Then, it iteratively calculates the values of `T3`, `T4`, ..., up to `Tn`, each time using the previously calculated values (i.e., the solutions to smaller subproblems) to compute the next value.

Here's how it's demonstrated:

1. **Initialization of Base Cases**: The values of `T0`, `T1`, and `T2` are known and initialized in the array `dp`. These base cases are the smallest subproblems.
2. **Iterative Computation**: Starting from `i = 3`, the algorithm iteratively computes `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3]`. Each `dp[i]` depends on the three previous values, which have already been computed. This is a key characteristic of the bottom-up approach, where you "build up" the solution from the bottom (the smallest, simplest subproblems) to the top (the original problem).
3. **Storage in a DP Array**: The computed values are stored in a `dp` array, which is used to avoid recalculating the same values, thereby saving computation time. This array acts as a memoization structure but is filled iteratively rather than through recursion.

In summary, the "bottom-up" nature is evident in the way the algorithm iteratively solves for and stores the values of the Tribonacci sequence from the smallest index (base cases) to the largest (the given `n`), using the solutions of smaller problems to solve larger ones. This approach efficiently computes the result with a direct forward progression through the sequence, avoiding the overhead of recursion and repeated calculations found in a naive recursive approach.在动态规划中，“自底向上”（bottom-up）的方法是指从最小的子问题开始解决问题，逐渐构建解决方案直到达到原始问题的规模。在Tribonacci数列的例子中，自底向上的体现在于：

1. **初始化基础情况**：首先解决最简单的子问题，即直接给出`T0`、`T1`和`T2`的值。这是构建整个解决方案的基础。
2. **迭代构建**：然后，从`T3`开始，每个`Tn`的值都是基于前三个数（`Tn-1`、`Tn-2`和`Tn-3`）的和。这意味着为了计算`T4`，我们需要`T3`、`T2`和`T1`的值；为了计算`T5`，我们需要`T4`、`T3`和`T2`的值，以此类推。
3. **逐步递增**：我们不是从顶部（即直接尝试解决`Tn`）开始，而是从底部（`T0`、`T1`、`T2`）开始，通过已解决的较小问题的解逐步构建出更大问题的解。每一步都建立在之前步骤的结果之上，这就是“自底向上”。

在上述Java代码的动态规划实现中，“自底向上”的体现就在于用一个循环从`i=3`开始计算，直到`n`，在每一步都利用前三个已计算出的Tribonacci数值来计算下一个数值。这个过程没有使用递归调用，而是迭代地更新数组`dp`中的每一个值，这正是“自底向上”的策略。
