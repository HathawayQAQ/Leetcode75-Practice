# DP: 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

## Problem ##
https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/

## Problem Description ##
> - You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `ith` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.
>
>   You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.
>
>   Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.
>
>    
>
>   **Example 1:**
>
>   ```
>   Input: cost = [10,15,20]
>   Output: 15
>   Explanation: You will start at index 1.
>   - Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
>   The total cost is 15.
>   ```
>
>   **Example 2:**
>
>   ```
>   Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
>   Output: 6
>   Explanation: You will start at index 0.
>   - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
>   - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
>   - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
>   - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
>   - Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
>   - Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
>   The total cost is 6.
>   ```
>
>    
>
>   **Constraints:**
>
>   - `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
>   - `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## My Solution - Java (Only passes 147/284) ##
``` java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int currentCost = 0;
        int currentIndex = 0;

        // Base Case
        // Start from index 0 or 1
        currentCost = Math.min(cost[0], cost[1]);

       // Compare to climb 0 or 1
       for (int i = 0; i < cost.length - 2; i++) {
           // Compare to climb 1 or 2 steps
           if (cost[i + 1] > cost[i + 2]) {
               currentCost += cost[i + 2];
               currentIndex += 2;
               // System.out.println(currentCost);
               System.out.println(currentIndex);
           }
       }
       // For the last 3
       currentCost += Math.min(cost[cost.length - 3] + cost[cost.length - 1], cost[cost.length - 2]);


    return currentCost;
    }
}
```

## Improved Solution - Button Up ##

``` java
class Solution {
    public int minCostClimbingStairs(int[] cost) {
        int n = cost.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]);
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

1. Initialize an array `dp` of the same length as `cost`, where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost to reach step `i`.
2. Fill in the base cases: `dp[0] = cost[0]` and `dp[1] = cost[1]`.
3. Iterate from the third step to the end of the staircase, calculating the minimum cost to reach each step as the minimum of reaching it from one or two steps below plus the current step's cost.
4. The answer will be the minimum of the last two `dp` values because you can reach the top from either of the last two steps.
5. dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]);
   - dp[i]: The minimum cost to reach the i th step, but not including the i th step itself
   - dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2]: The minimum cost to reach the (i-1) st and (i-2) rd step respectively
   - After reaching (i-1) st or (i-2) rd step, we should add the cost for themselves.
